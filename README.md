# file-transport

## Indro
It is just used to transport file through linux-platform.

## How to use
- First make sure you guys are in the same LAN.
- CPP_VERSION:
I've provided the compiled one, so you can just type(in intel-platform):
```
./server.out
```
in one terminal, and the other person in another terminal types:
```
./client.out
```

- GO_VERSION
I've also provided the compiled one, you can just type:
```
./file_transmit
```
and then your partner can visit:`your ip address:9090`
